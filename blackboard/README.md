## n-dimensional blackboard 

"certain generic ai's" seems to need some hints about environmental features and dimensionality in the capacity of a 
learning agent.
  
this abstraction attempts to bridge current "ai" implementation with equivalent logic working on greater dimensionality 
signals as well as ESB interface conveniences. 

* blackboard:
       an environment https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_system 
* action potential:
       a blackboard feature with addressability 
* signal: 
        an action potential with an input translation
* actor:
        a signal with an output translation 
* subsystem:
        an unshared actor that has plural channels providing arities for deimnsional reduction     
* instrumentation:
        full taxonomical runtime access to source code, hypervisor state, proc and debugfs, strace, shell, elf 
        libraries, etc. of the operational runtime
