## signal pattern recognition and encoding gateway for higher level languages   

this project is to test the premise of programming in higher dimensions using dimensionally reduced transmission
techniques to indicate program state, instructions, instruction effects, object mutation and lifecycle.

Without a grounding in the latex expressions to describe I will nevertheless state the intent here..

for a given program, we typically have a language, parameter, instructions, datatypes, and well defined finite 
execution properties forming the basis for a thing humans run on computers to perform work.   

it is my hope to express these factors in terms of pushing a marble through space (rolling optional) and declaring a 
program's state as a collection of trajectories signaled-by energy changes to the signal along 1 dimension, and describe 
effects as concentric onion rings that or as interesting planes with program state trajectories along a sinusoidal 
curve.
   
the process of defining a program's execution happens at higher dimensions created by collision of state trajectory with 
instruction planes/bottles/orbits that represent existing empirical language constructs with virtual machine runtimes.

this defines the difficult mapping.  

my programmer's intuition leads me to estimate the following:
 
 * identifying vectors of instructions, and trajectories of runtime libraries loaded in advance of a user's intended 
   program state must occur uniformly.  

 * arriving at fields, geometries, and wave-particle effects to approximate code written in ordinary programming 
 languages is the author's chosen thesis project.    
 
 * extending program expression through rlnc is a goal.  
   
A version of opennars software has been used as a research vehicle to measure the fit of a relatively succinct codebase
capable of demonstrating learning along limitted dimensional frame of reference.
